# miniPlacesChallengeMIT6.869
MIT 6.869 class project for scene recognition using Tensorflow

This folder contains two of our final models, Res50 and BanRes.
To train, please run 'python3 res50.py' or 'python ban_res2.py'
These two models share the same dataloader called read_batch.py.
But they have different files to define the parameters, which are
called para50.py and ban_para2.py respectively.
